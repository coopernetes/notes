# Open Source anti-patterns
Notes on Bryan Cantrill's talk.
Source: https://youtu.be/Pm8P4oCIY3g

1. Inverted thinking
* "what will this buy me?"
* Right way to think about it: "what will this cost me?"

2. Wishful thinking
* "The choice is not if they pay you or not, but rather if they run your software or not"
* "If they weren't running your software, they'd be running your competitor's."
* "If they write their own software, that will put you out of business"
* Significant marginal gain from others using your software
* When you have an API, you get a network effect by having more people use your software.
* Lead gen! If someone is using your software, that's probably a pretty well qualified lead.

3. No source
* Announce you're open sourcing with source code, never without.
* lose credibility, reeks of emphasizing perception over reality

4. Forkaphobia
* _forking paradox_: the easier it is to fork, the more difficult it is to fork the community
* encourage experimentation
* "open source that cannot be forked has no vitality"

5. Governance [sic] overload
* gives rise to a focus on governance grossly out of proportion with any project
