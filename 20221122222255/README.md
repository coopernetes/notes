6. Ersatz democracy
* much easier to establish governance than to respect that governance

7. Eschewing leadership
* people want leadership even though they will participate. "You wrote it! You had the vision"
* good projects have good leadership
* must be exerted in a transparent and inclusive way (the "B" in "BDFL")
* technical leadership gives visibility to the engineers who created it
* it's good for your brand and engineers
* organizations don't innovate - **people do**
* you have an organization that fosters and cultivates innovative people

8. Eschewing ownership
* fashionable to open source software by giving it to a foundation
* you can be legitimate w/o giving software to a foundation
* signals that the company is stepping away from the code, leaving it for dead
* can't retain ownership or leadership

9. Competitive paranoia
* not-invented-here (NIH) is so strong, competitor will go out of business before
  they take your innovation
* companies that adopt your tech are almost always not your competitor

10. Anti-collaborative licensing
* GPL/AGPL very expansion definition of derived work. "has been called toxic, viral"
* very important in late 80's/early 90's
* strong copyleft use is declining

_2022 stats_ (source: https://www.mend.io/resources/blog/open-source-licenses-trends-and-predictions/)
* "78% of open source components have permissive licenses"
* "Only 22% of open source licenses are copyleft, compared to 24% last year."
* "While GPLv3 keeps its third place position, it dropped from 10% in 2020 to 9% in 2021. GPLv2 also kept its fourth place position, going down to 9% from 10% last year"

11. Dual license for profit
* gives you backwards incentives, "incentivizes you to FUD the open source version"
* doesn't say you can't have open source software with proprietary extensions

12. Demanding assignment
* be careful. relies on a community trusting a commercial entity
* it's not just a contract, it's a social contract
* corporate entities may (and should) have a contributor agreement to protect against 3rd party claims of copyright/infringement
