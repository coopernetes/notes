# I need to learn some C on Raspberry Pi
Originally written on iPhone 09/19.

I need to learn how to write some basic C. I think I should take the raspberry
pi and make it blink a light to start. Then, I can try some other random shit
on the hardware. Make it blink different colours if the day's weather report
is predicting bad weather? Green = sunny, yellow = rain, red = storm / snow.

I have no idea what the hardware is right now. TBD.
