# Open Source, or how I stopped worrying and learned to live without a vendor
Another blog entry idea.

Bryan Cantrill talks about this in his talk [Zebras All The Way Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE2KDzZaxvE).

The Vendorâ„¢ does not exist*.

*Yes, there is commercially supported open source. But that does not encompass
the vast majority of OSS (can this be measured?)

Before open source dominated software and the cloud, organizations had two choices:

1. Procure software or technology from a vendor, implement it (usually with
   ProServ) and pay for ongoing support in the form of contracts and/or
   licenses.

2. Write the software in-house.

Open source has the benefit of outside expertise with the convenience of free*
or accessible. By passively consuming, companies are continuing their old
trajectory of being a customer. Since there is no vendor, it's in an organization's
best interest to participate in the communities they rely on.

(not free as in beer - need to look up this saying)
