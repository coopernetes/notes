# List of documentation creation projects or tools
I write a lot of documentation and haven't found the best set of projects
that fit every use case. However, these projects are pretty good "general
purpose" tools for writing in general. Making a note here to list them
and remind me to get better with at least 1-2 more.

(this should really be titled "list of open source projects for generating,
formatting or hosting written content...*such as documentation*").

- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). What I'm most familiar with. GitHub Pages integration,
  Markdown + React. Very powerful but unwieldy at times. Also have the problem
  of aggregation and discovery when you have multiple docusaurus sites...
- [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/). Used by all the Cool Rust People. Has a
  [commercial angle/offering](https://www.gitbook.com/pricing)?
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Used by my "personal site" on GitHub Pages
  but I never created any meaningful content on there.
- [DocBook](https://docbook.org/)
- [AsciiDoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/)
- [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) (uses [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) under the hood) 

More niche ones.
- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/). "de facto standard for the 
  communication and publication of scientific documents". I should just be
  aware of it.

Including for completion, not because I have a need for it (at this time).
- [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/). Yes, I [did have a Wordpress blog](https://notanothernetworkblog.wordpress.com/)
  a loooong time ago so I'm obligated to include it.
- [Medium](https://medium.com). No thanks.
