# Idea using GitHub blocks
A mini game that uses data from devops tools to visualize or populate actors?

Could be a simple little puzzle game. Or maybe a zero player game, like rain that is generated
by commits pushed, PRs merged, builds or scans completed or failed?

There is some inherent randomness. Maybe it's a heat map you have to zap with your mouse? The
heat map can map to orgs or repos. Maybe repo names so it doesn't shame anyone. Jenkins builds. 
Testing invoked or passed (# of tests ran, failed, passed). If a commit is pushed, that's a big
box with a few points and if a release happens, a flood of small squares appears?

BUBBLE BOBBLE CLONE!
