# Open Source blog ideas

1. "We're all in this together". Why large organizations cannot sit on the
sidelines of open source software.
- Take a measurement of open source consumption at $dayjob. Top projects
  in use
- Corporate sponsorships should be part of a yearly budget for the most
  mission critical (see: most used) projects
- Your strongest software developers *want* to contribute. At the very
  least, it must be allowed to open and participate in issues to report
  bugs and/or suggest enhancements
- Contributions back to projects build trust
- Evidence of incidents where a few maintainers were on the hook for a
  critical dependency. Examples (need more): OpenSSL & heart bleed, left-pad,
  log4j.

2. Respect your contributors, don't be afraid of them.
- CLA or DCO for new contributors?
- DCO claims to reduce friction. Is that true?
- Are CLA's always about corporate CYA?

3. You can't mitigate the risk of open source without doing open source.
- your company already deploys open source software to production but they
  are cutoff from the actual community they depend & rely on.
- instead of relying on free labour and volunteers, allocate open source work
  as part of your backlog or sprints (similar to IP sprints or kaizen).
- the "supply chain" doesn't exist, it is a loose collection of good samaritans
- Include Price's Law

I have more thoughts on this matter but I can't remember them for right now.
